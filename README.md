# MyVIM
My personal set-up of VIM

**Currently in place:**
- [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
  - "Manage your 'runtimepath' with ease. In practical terms, pathogen.vim makes it super easy to install plugins and runtime files in their own private directories."
- [Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
  - "Lean & mean status/tabline for vim that's light as air."
